# Step 1: Creating an account

First, head to [ejenda.org](https://ejenda.org) and click the Join button
Once there, create a new account by creating a username and password. Make sure the password is at least a 3/4, otherwise, it won't be acccepted!
After you've selected your login credentials, hit the sign up button

# Step 2: Signing up with your school

Once you hit the sign up button, you will be prompted to enter your school domain.
This will _not_ be used to track you and is only used for our upcoming Ejenda blocks feature.
Your school domain is most likely the domain used for your school's website (school.org), however it may also be the domain of your school issued email (email<span>@</span>school.org). If Ejenda is already in use at your school, it should show up below the input box as "You are at (whatever your school name is)"
Simply click the "Let's get started" button to finish signup. If your school does not show up, it will prompt you to add your school. **NOTE: If after clicking the add button, nothing happens, close out of the add school window and refresh the page. This should automatically add your school to the system. If you are still unable to add your school, contact support@ejenda.org**. After your school is added, proceed as normal.
